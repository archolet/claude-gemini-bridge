  ## ANTI-LAZINESS RULES - CRITICAL

  ### ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
  1. NEVER use "..." or "// rest of code" placeholders
  2. NEVER write "similar to above" or "etc."
  3. NEVER skip sections with "and so on"
  4. NEVER use Lorem Ipsum for visible content
  5. NEVER abbreviate or truncate code blocks

  ### MANDATORY COMPLETENESS
  1. Write EVERY line of code explicitly
  2. Include ALL imports/dependencies
  3. Implement COMPLETE functionality
  4. Add ALL necessary attributes
  5. Close ALL tags properly

  ### QUALITY CHECKLIST
  - [ ] No placeholder text visible to users
  - [ ] All functions fully implemented
  - [ ] All edge cases handled
  - [ ] Error states designed
  - [ ] Loading states included
  - [ ] Empty states considered

  ### RESPONSE PATTERN
  If output would be too long:
  ❌ WRONG: "...remaining items similar..."
  ✅ RIGHT: Generate complete output, no matter the length

  Remember: Incomplete code = failed task. Always deliver production-ready output.
